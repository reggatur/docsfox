## Templates

Docsfox uses normal document files as templates for producing new, customized documents specific to individual clients. It supports MS Word (.DOCX), LibreOffice Writer (.ODT), and plain text (.TXT) files. Data that is merged into templates to produce documents is stored in standard .CSV files. They can be edited with MS Excel, LibreOffice Calc, other spreadsheet software, or even text editors.

## Variables

Like other document assembly applications, Docsfox automates the creation of documents using variables in templates.  You insert variables like `<<ClientFirst>>` and `<<ClientLast>>` into template files. Docsfox searches and replaces these variables with corresponding text you enter in a data file. You won't risk leave old, wrong names and variable information in new documents as you would if you reuse old client documents instead of using Docsfox.

## Optional Clauses

Docsfox allows you to have optional and alternative clauses. You can easily choose to include or exclude any of the clauses in your template. Optional text and clauses are entered into your templates surrounded by tags like: `<<Clause1>>The contract may be terminated via email.<<Clause1/>>`. To include optional text or an optional clause, you enter T (for True) in the Type column of the client's data file.

## Safe and Private

Completely secure and private, Docsfox operates entirely on your computer. Your text and client information can be kept entirely on you computer.  It does not use AI that sends your content across the internet and may expose it to other users of the AI service.

Docsfox coding is fully transparent. Your data and template text stay on your computer

Docsfox saves you time and prevents drafting mistakes so easy to make when reusing existing documents.
