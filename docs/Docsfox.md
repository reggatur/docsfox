# Docsfox Documentation
## Free, secure document assembly software

## Summary

Docsfox is a free, secure, open source application used to assemble customized documents.

**Free:** Docsfox is completely free for commercial and personal use.

In contrast, other document assembly services are powerful and expensive. They cost you time with long learning curves and numerous steps to create document templates. They cost you money every month with costly subscriptions. 

**Secure:** Docsfox can work entirely on your computer. It is open source, so you can see it has no code that connects to the internet. You can keep your templates and generated documents local. Optionally, you can use Docsfox with online documents, for example, in Microsoft 365 or Google Docs.

In contrast, online document assembly services raise concerns about the privacy of your client information and document content. Hosted in the cloud, your client information and documents are subject to security breaches at the vendor. AI features present other privacy risks.

**Easy:** Learning and using Docsfox are quick and easy. Create and reuse templates from existing documents as needed, undeterred by the prospect of grappling with complexity.

## Alternatives
### Search and replace

The most common, free alternative to Docsfox is your word processor's Search and Replace feature. That method of reusing your work product is:
- **Time-consuming**, requiring multiple passes to replace each piece of variable text
- **Tedious**, involving inspection of the context of each word or phrase
- **Error-prone**, leaving behind names and information that doesn't precisely match
- **Duplicative**, requiring repeated manual task for each one of multiple documents
### Open source software

[DocAssemble] is the only alternative, free, open source document assembly application. It is powerful, complex, and very time-consuming to install, configure and use for template creation. It lends itself to large projects in large, typically non-profit organizations.
### Commercial document assembly subscriptions

Docsfox offers a free, simple alternative. It lacks advanced capabilities of commercial services, yet delivers the most used, labor-saving features.
